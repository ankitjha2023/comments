# comments
The "Comments" repository is a web application built using Bootstrap, JavaScript, and the Firebase Realtime Database. It provides users with the ability to add comments that are stored in the Firebase Realtime Database. This ensures that the comments persist even when the page is refreshed.

## Features
1. User-friendly Interface: The application is built using the Bootstrap framework, ensuring a responsive and intuitive user interface. Users can easily navigate through the comment section and interact with the application seamlessly.
2. Comment Persistence: The Firebase Realtime Database is utilized to store and retrieve comments. Whenever a user adds a comment, it is immediately stored in the database. This ensures that the comments remain intact, even if the page is refreshed or the user revisits the application at a later time.
3. Real-time Updates: The application leverages the real-time capabilities of the Firebase Realtime Database. As new comments are added, they are instantly displayed on the page without requiring a manual refresh. Users can therefore see all comments in real-time, fostering a dynamic and engaging user experience.
